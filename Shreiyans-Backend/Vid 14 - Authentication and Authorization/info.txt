user ko profile dene se phle check krna
 hota h ki user hai kon = Authentication

authorised to perform some taks which 
only allowed to be executed  by the admin

server har baar bhool jata h ki aap kon ho ,

to avoid we use cookies and session concept

1 - How to set cookies
2 - bcrypt for enc and decry
3 - jwt and store data in jwt 


2 
password = password
if database is hacked then we have to encrypt it 

like we can use algos like sha256 , 
and bcrypt helps to do this

enc
$2b$10$340K8TUzww1awY00hjW35u
$2b$10$340K8TUzww1awY00hjW35u1/nlDvGi3iOM/AvrMiwJ1nfadojYOkO


when we create a account we encrypt a password 
and this encrypted password is stored in db
so hume toh apna password yaad h 
so mera password and hash value if equal then we will looged in 

so later we will password ko hash and hash ko hash k sath match 


jwt
server ek string bjta h contains 3 parts
string me data ko encrypt krte h

phle baar toh server bjta h jb device dobara req marta h toh purple wale part se 
pta lg jaega ki ki naam ky h dono ka toh hhume pochna nahi prega ki kon h
